Tried to use jack with aubio to be able to discern a pithc in real time

Ended up trying to configure ALSA to work with JACK, also trying to configure JACK - with little success

Divide values given from PortAudioRecPlay by 10,000 and read them in in blocks of 8 when processing the sound using aubio. Divide by 10,000 because values given in the array of floats that aubio uses are between -1 and 1. 

Compile the program --make sure to check in parseargs

Match degrees of robots arm movement to match a frequency change in Hz, starting with a change of 1 degree producing a change of "x"Hz




Cbits compilations:
gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fPIC utils.c -I../../aubio-0.4.0/src
gcc -shared -fPIC -o libCaubio.so utils.c -I../../aubio-0.4.0/src -L../../aubio-0.4.0/build/src/libaubio.a

Shouldn't need to execute this line, but just in case:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/icub/Documents/MMP-George/Theremin/cbits:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
